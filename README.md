# Andrew-Chen-Wang/github-wiki-action@v1
Updates your GitHub wiki by using rsync.

This action updates your repository's wiki
based on a single directory that matches with
your Wiki's git.

_**It is recommended that you still have a Home.md
or whatever extension you want instead of MD.**_ This
is so that GitHub doesn't automatically make a Home.md
for you again.

You can use a Wiki directory from any repository you wish.
Take a look at [action.yml](https://github.com/Andrew-Chen-Wang/github-wiki-action/blob/master/action.yml)
for all inputs.

### Usage

You must have a single wiki page available from the beginning.
It can be blank, but there must be at least one page that exists.
You must also have a directory where all your wiki files will
be located (the default directory is "wiki/").

```yaml
name: Deploy Wiki

on:
  push:
    paths:
      # Trigger only when wiki directory changes
      - 'wiki/**'
    branches:
      # And only on master branch
      - master

jobs:
  deploy-wiki:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Push Wiki Changes
      uses: Andrew-Chen-Wang/github-wiki-action@v1
      env:
        # Make sure you have that / at the end. We use rsync 
        # WIKI_DIR's default is wiki/
        WIKI_DIR: wiki/
        GH_PAT: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
        GH_MAIL: ${{ secrets.YOUR_EMAIL }}
        GH_NAME: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
```

You're going to need a Personal Access Token with the minimal scopes of
[seen here.](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=wiki%20page%20creator%20token)

Largely inspired by [wiki-page-creator-action](https://github.com/Decathlon/wiki-page-creator-action)
and the [issue that arose from it](https://github.com/Decathlon/wiki-page-creator-action/issues/11),
this GitHub action tries to update the entire wiki based on a single
directory. It is not as rich in functionality (i.e. the only missing
functionality is that you can't skip files), but it addresses
the issue of deleting Wiki pages.
