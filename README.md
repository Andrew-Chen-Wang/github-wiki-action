## Installation

![GitHub Actions](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=GitHub+Actions&color=2088FF&logo=GitHub+Actions&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)

Add a GitHub Actions workflow file to your `.github/workflows/` folder similar
to the example shown below.

```yml
name: Publish to GitHub wiki
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths: [wiki/**, .github/workflows/publish-to-github-wiki.yml]
concurrency:
  group: publish-to-github-wiki
  cancel-in-progress: true
jobs:
  publish-to-github-wiki:
    environment:
      name: github-wiki
      url: ${{ steps.publish-to-github-wiki.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - id: publish-to-github-wiki
        uses: jcbhmr/publish-to-github-wiki@v2
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure that any changes made to the Markdown files in the GitHub Action
are committed (at least locally). This GitHub Action splits the Git history, not
the state of the current directory. Untracked or uncommitted changes will be
ignored.

## Usage

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=GitHub&color=181717&logo=GitHub&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)

After creating your workflow file, now all you need is to put your Markdown
files in a `wiki/` folder (or whatever you set the `path` option to) and commit
them to your default branch to trigger the workflow (or whatever other trigger
you set up).

üí° Each page has an auto-generated title. It is derived from the filename by
replacing every `-` (dash) character with a space. Name your files accordingly.

üí° The `Home.md` file will automatically become the homepage, not `README.md`.
This is specific to GitHub wikis.

### Options

| Option | Description                                                                                                             | Default |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `path` | Path to the wiki folder with Markdown files in it. Usually this is something like "wiki" or "docs". Defaults to "wiki". | `wiki`  |

### Outputs

| Output     | Description                                        | Example                                                 |

## Development

![Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=Codespaces&color=181717&logo=GitHub&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)
![Devcontainers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=Devcontainers&color=2496ED&logo=Docker&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)

This project consists of a single file. If you're making a small change, you
probably don't need a full dev environment and can just edit the file in the
GitHub web editor or [GitHub.dev].

But, if you really want some of that Bash intellisense, this project comes
with a devcontainer config equipped with a Bash extension pack and some other
GitHub Actions helpers like [`act`] and a few intellisense extensions for
`actions.yml`.

The way this project is tested is directly on this repository. The
<kbd>Wiki</kbd> tab on this repository is completely nonsensical and is there
only to test this action on itself.

### Creating a new release

Right now the release process is manual. Here are the steps:

1. Create a semver GitHub Release: v1.2.3
2. Mutate/create the minor tag to point to the new release: v1.2
3. Mutate/create the major tag to point to the new release: v1
3. `git push --tags`

We end up with tags like this:

```
# Patch tags
v1.0.0
v1.0.1
v1.1.0
v2.0.0

# Minor tags
v1.0 => v1.0.1
v1.1 => v1.1.0
v2.0 => v2.0.0

# Major tags
v1 => v1.1.0
v2 => v2.0.0
```

# Andrew-Chen-Wang/github-wiki-action
Updates your GitHub wiki by using rsync.

This action updates your repository's wiki
based on a single directory that matches with
your Wiki's git. You can use a Wiki directory
from any repository you wish.

_**It is recommended that you still have a Home.md
or whatever extension you want instead of MD.**_ This
is so that GitHub doesn't automatically make a Home.md
for you again.

### Features

- rsync all your files from one directory (either from the current or other repository) to your GitHub's repo's wiki.
    - rsyncing from a different repository requires a [GitHub PAT](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=wiki%20page%20creator%20token)
    - If you use a private repository, you may have to use a GitHub PAT.
- Use the commit message from your repository's git's commit. You can specify a custom one if you want.
- Be able to exclude files and directories based on an input of a list.

---
### Usage

You must have a single wiki page available from the beginning.
It can be blank, but there must be at least one page that exists.
You must also have a directory where all your wiki files will
be located (the default directory is "wiki/"). To include the
mandatory homepage, have a file in your wiki/ directory
called Home.md or with any other extension (e.g. rst).

```yaml
name: Deploy Wiki

on:
  push:
    paths:
      # Trigger only when wiki directory changes
      - 'wiki/**'
    branches:
      # And only on master branch
      - master

jobs:
  deploy-wiki:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Push Wiki Changes
      uses: Andrew-Chen-Wang/github-wiki-action@v3
      env:
        # Make sure you have that / at the end. We use rsync
        # WIKI_DIR's default is wiki/
        WIKI_DIR: wiki/
        GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        GH_MAIL: ${{ secrets.YOUR_EMAIL }}
        GH_NAME: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
        EXCLUDED_FILES: "a/ b.md"
```

If you plan on having a different repository host your wiki
directory, you're going to need a Personal Access Token instead of the `GITHUB_TOKEN`
with the minimal scopes [seen here.](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=wiki%20page%20creator%20token). If you are using a private
repository, the same rule applies.

---
### Inputs

| Argument | Required | Default value | Description |
|----------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| WIKI_DIR | No | wiki/ | Directory to rsync files to the wiki.(https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo). |
| GH_TOKEN | Yes | | The GitHub Token for this action to use. Specify `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` for public repositories. If you're commiting to a different repository or a private repository, create a [GitHub PAT](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=wiki%20page%20creator%20token) and save it in GitHub secrets as `GH_TOKEN`. Then, specify in your action `${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}`. |
| GH_MAIL | Yes | | The email associated with the token. |
| GH_NAME | Yes | | The username associated with the token. |
| EXCLUDED_FILES | No | | The files or directories you want to exclude. Note, we use rsync |
| REPO | No | `${{ github.repository }}` | The target repository. Default is the current repo. If you specify a different repository (e.g. Andrew-Chen-Wang/github-wiki-action), then you must use a PAT. |
| WIKI_PUSH_MESSAGE | No | Your commit's message | The message to add to your commit to the wiki git |

---
### Inspiration
This intended usage was to avoid hosting a private ReadTheDocs
and instead just use GitHub wiki.

Largely inspired by [wiki-page-creator-action](https://github.com/Decathlon/wiki-page-creator-action)
and the [issue that arose from it](https://github.com/Decathlon/wiki-page-creator-action/issues/11),
this GitHub action tries to update the entire wiki based on a single
directory.
